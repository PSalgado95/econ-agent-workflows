# GPT Pro Handoff

## Purpose

Prepare a task-shaped handoff package for GPT Pro.

The goal is not merely to zip files. The goal is to give GPT Pro a clean operating environment:

- the right evidence;
- the right reading order;
- the right scope boundary;
- the right return contract;
- and a prompt shaped around outcome, success criteria, evidence rules, and stopping conditions.

For current handoffs, do not carry forward old process-heavy prompt habits by default. Start from the smallest prompt that preserves the product contract, make the desired outcome explicit, and avoid prescribing a path unless the exact reading order or output shape is binding.

Default to the weakest sufficient packaging:

- `lean` for narrow review, comparison, interpretation, and bounded design questions;
- `staged` once the task has multiple artefact types, multiple audiences, implementation surfaces, prior-round dependence, or a binding output contract.

Use the current packaging script as the packaging layer, but decide the package shape before you run it.

Use the script default output folder, `~/Downloads/GPT Pro Packages`, unless the user supplies `--downloads-dir`. Do not save final GPT Pro bundles inside the project repo unless the user explicitly asks for that.

## Core operating rule

Keep one reusable core workflow, then apply a small archetype overlay.

The reusable core always does seven things:

1. lock the ask;
2. choose package mode and archetype;
3. curate files by role;
4. define success criteria and evidence rules;
5. write a short explicit prompt;
6. check that the prompt has a stop rule;
7. return the package path, the standalone prompt-file path when one is created, and the full paste-ready prompt directly in the chat.

Do not satisfy "return the full prompt" by only linking or pointing to a prompt file. The final response must include the complete prompt text inline so the user can paste it into GPT Pro immediately. The final response must also include the package path as a plain copyable filesystem path, not only as a clickable Markdown link.

Do not treat every handoff as the same kind of problem.

## Quick start

### Lean package example

Use this when the task is narrow and the package can stay mostly flat.

```bash
python "<path-to-installed-skill>/scripts/build_handoff_package.py" \
  --task "Interpret the macro results and explain the main identification risks." \
  --title "macro-results-interpretation" \
  --workspace "<path-to-project-repo>" \
  --include "docs/active-lp-workflow.md" \
  --include "config/lp/expanded_macro_validation_v1.json" \
  --include "output/results/lp/checks" \
  --instruction "Write for an economist-facing audience." \
  --instruction "Focus on mechanisms, objections, and next checks."
```

### Staged package example

Use this when the task needs stronger reading order, multiple artefact classes, or a binding return contract.

1. Create a small temporary stage workspace.
2. Put role folders at the stage workspace root:
   - `package/`
   - `evidence/`
   - `code/`
   - `shared/`
   - `discussion/`
   - `drafts/`
3. Put control files such as `return_contract.md`, `governing_direction.md`, or `repo_scan.md` inside `package/`.
4. Run the same script against that stage workspace.

```bash
python "<path-to-installed-skill>/scripts/build_handoff_package.py" \
  --task "Produce an economist-facing measurement memo plus an implementation-ready patch plan." \
  --title "measurement-patch-plan" \
  --workspace "<path-to-temporary-stage-workspace>" \
  --include "package" \
  --include "evidence" \
  --include "code" \
  --include "shared" \
  --instruction "Read package control files before touching the live code surface." \
  --instruction "Return the human memo and the implementation artefacts separately."
```

Important: do not create a nested local `source/` folder inside the stage workspace before running the current script. The script already copies selected material into final `source/`, so nested local `source/` folders will create `source/source/...` in the final bundle.

## Workflow

### 1. Lock the ask

Extract and record:

- the core task;
- the primary audience or audiences;
- whether the task is review, design, synthesis, revision, or hybrid implementation;
- whether the preferred return is artefact-first;
- and whether external research is wanted.

Preserve the user's stated objective. Do not silently substitute a different review question.

Defaults:

- If the user does not specify the output shape, prefer a short readable summary plus artefact-first main output for substantial tasks.
- If the user asks for multiple outputs, say `Return exactly N deliverables`.
- Ask a blocking clarification only when you genuinely cannot determine the workspace or the core execution surface. Do not ask cleanup questions when a reasonable default exists.

### 2. Choose package mode and archetype

Use [references/package-archetypes.md](references/package-archetypes.md).

#### Choose `lean` when all of these hold

- one central question;
- one primary audience;
- no binding revised-file or diff bundle;
- no need to separate discussion, evidence, and code strongly;
- and a small decisive file set should suffice.

#### Choose `staged` when any two of these hold

- multiple deliverables or audiences;
- revised files, diffs, or named artefacts are required;
- the evidence spans different classes such as code, discussion, drafts, data, and references;
- prior-round context materially matters;
- reading order needs active control;
- scope boundaries or non-goals need reinforcement;
- or the cost of acting on the wrong interpretation is high.

If a package begins lean but the prompt starts carrying many governance rules, escalate to staged mode instead of making the prompt heavier.

### 3. Curate by file role, not only by path

Use [references/package-selection.md](references/package-selection.md).

Prioritise, in order:

1. governing context;
2. decisive evidence;
3. the minimal live execution surface;
4. one compact manifest of omissions and warnings;
5. examples only when they clarify the archetype.

Do not use GPT Pro as a dump target for the whole repo.

### 4. Decide whether to use a staged workspace

#### Lean mode

You can package directly from the project workspace.

#### Staged mode

Create a temporary stage workspace first.

Why:

- it lets you separate `package`, `evidence`, `code`, `shared`, `discussion`, and `drafts`;
- it makes the final reading order much cleaner;
- and it avoids forcing the prompt to carry structure that should live in files.

For staged packages, the temporary workspace root should contain role folders directly, because the current packaging script will place them under final `source/`.

### 5. Write control files

The final package root should always contain:

- `handoff_brief.md`
- `handoff_prompt.txt`
- `package_manifest.md`

For staged packages, place additional control files inside `package/` in the stage workspace so they land in final `source/package/`.

Use these only when they carry real load:

- `governing_direction.md`
- `reading_order.md`
- `return_contract.md` or `return_contract.yaml`
- `repo_scan.md`
- `scope_notes.md`

Separate roles cleanly:

- the prompt should state the task objective;
- the return contract should define filenames, sections, revised files, and bundle structure when needed.

Do not force exact filenames into the prompt when a return-contract file can carry them more cleanly.

### 6. Build the prompt

Use [references/prompt-patterns.md](references/prompt-patterns.md).

Good prompt habits:

- start with the user-visible outcome, not a long procedure;
- state success criteria for what must be true before the final answer;
- say how to use the package only where reading order or role separation matters;
- separate scope, evidence rules, and output shape;
- make the deliverables explicit;
- use hard words such as `must`, `always`, and `never` only for true invariants such as safety rules, binding output contracts, or no-change rules;
- keep working rules short and high value;
- ask for outside research in one clear line when wanted;
- tell GPT Pro to call out missing evidence before leaning on it;
- include verification expectations when the task is code-facing, visual, or implementation-planning;
- and include a stop rule that defines when enough evidence is enough.

Do not over-prescribe internal reasoning. A clear outcome, evidence contract, and definition of done are more useful than a pseudo-procedure.

### 7. Use examples carefully

Use [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) and [references/package-archetypes.md](references/package-archetypes.md).

Examples are for pattern transfer, not template copying.

Include examples when:

- the archetype is otherwise ambiguous;
- the return contract is unusual;
- or the task needs a concrete contrast between lean and staged handling.

Do not ship old bespoke packages by default.

### 8. Use the script as the packaging layer

The current script handles:

- staging in `~/Downloads/GPT Pro Packages` by default;
- copied source selection;
- `handoff_brief.md`;
- `handoff_prompt.txt`;
- `package_manifest.md`;
- standalone prompt file creation;
- and final zip creation.

Important naming note:

- the current script produces stems of the form `gptpro_MM-DD_label`
- for example:
  - `~/Downloads/GPT Pro Packages/gptpro_04-15_macro-results-interpretation.zip`
  - `~/Downloads/GPT Pro Packages/gptpro_04-15_macro-results-interpretation_prompt.txt`

Do not document an output naming convention that differs from what the script actually does.

### 9. Review before replying

Check:

- does the file set actually match the task;
- did the package mode make sense;
- is the package lean enough to upload and inspect comfortably;
- are the root files readable;
- and did you accidentally create `source/source/...` nesting.

If the package is still noisy, trim it. Prefer fewer stronger files over broader coverage.

## Optional note on long-running context

If the user already keeps a ChatGPT Project or another long-running context store, treat that as optional background context only.

Do not make Projects part of the core operating rule of this skill, and do not tell the user to create one unless they explicitly want advice on longer-run organisation. The core package workflow should remain fully usable on its own.

## Response contract

This response contract is MANDATORY for every GPT Pro package: the final chat reply must include both the full prompt pasted in chat and the full absolute `.zip` path as plain copyable text, even when a standalone prompt `.txt` file is also created.

After packaging, always return:

- the final GPT Pro prompt in the first fenced `text` code block;
- the full absolute zip path in a second fenced `text` code block containing only that single path;
- and a brief note on mode, archetype, what was included, and what was trimmed or warned on.

Non-negotiable reply rules:

- Always paste the full final prompt in chat.
- Do not rely on the saved prompt file alone.
- Always return the zip path as a full absolute path.
- The zip-path block must contain only the `.zip` path and nothing else.
- Do not make the user click a link to copy the main artefact path; clickable Markdown links may be added only after the plain path block.
- Do not return only filenames; return full absolute paths.
- Do not say only that files were created.
- Do not make the user open a saved `.txt` file just to copy the prompt.
- Do not return the prompt-file path unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Guardrails

- Do not zip the whole repo by default.
- Do not include caches, logs, archives, duplicate renders, or broad intermediate folders unless they are the point of the handoff.
- Do not overfit to one historical package.
- Do not default to staged mode just because GPT Pro can handle more material.
- Do not default to lean mode when the output contract is already becoming multi-part and implementation-facing.
- Do not modify repo-tracked files as part of packaging.
- Do not claim any official GPT Pro-specific upload limit.
- Do not force a long fixed process unless the exact path is part of the task.
- When charts, diagrams, or rendered pages matter, prefer PDFs or exported views over source formats that hide visuals.
- When a spreadsheet is very large, prefer the decisive tabs, exports, or a compact explanatory note rather than a bloated workbook unless the workbook itself is the object of analysis.
